# The Final Project

<br> 

## Project aims and learning objectives

Over the next week and a bit you will work individually to carry out an **end-to-end data project**. This will allow you to consolidate and expand everything you have learned on the course.

The projects vary in terms of the questions asked. They may require a machine learning solution or it may be an in-depth analysis deep dive into a specific dataset looking for key insights. All should include **appropriate visualisation outputs**.

You will have to **present your findings using slides**. If you are doing the PDA you will also need to document your analysis steps in the form of a **report with embedded visualisations and text** (R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook) detailing key steps and insights, with appropriate documentation of data source, quality and ethics and any assumptions you've made. You can organise your project folders however you see fit, but remember to make your code reproducible, and keep the project organised and easy for others to navigate.

You can do your final project in either **R or Python**.

Remember the objective of this project is not to necessarily have the most impressive final presentation (you can always continue working on it after the course!). Use this project as a chance to get more **practice of skills**, whether that be coding Python or maybe you want to use R to get the data wrangling and then want to focus on practising modelling. It's up to you! 

<br> 

## The Brief

Each project has its own brief contained within the relevant folder.

Consider the following learning objectives when trying to answer your chosen brief:

* Capture requirements from the business and translate these into an achievable analysis project
* Create a project plan to deliver an outcome
* Identify the key insights and communicate these back to the business
* Maintain required client confidentiality

<div class="emphasis">

**Please note:** These briefs were written by your instructors. The data is openly available, and you will be able to post your project to a public GitHub. While the companies themselves did not write the brief, there is no issue with you showing them your work by tagging them on Github/LinkedIn/Twitter.

<br> 

## Expectations

As this is an end-to-end data project we'd like you to carry out and document each stage of your project. The steps we'd like to see are:

1.	**Defining:** identifying the question being solved and why it is important to the business
2.	**Planning:** plan the analysis and rough timings over the project period
3.	**Understanding:** initial understanding of provided data and identify any data augmentation
4.	**Analysing:** manipulation, modelling and validating
5.	**Concluding:** inferring and communicating findings through reports and visualisations
6.	**Implementing:** recommendations for real-world implementation, next steps and any limitations to using the findings and outputs.


## Confidentiality 

Please consider whether there are any confidentiality or ethical issues with the data in your project. The **current project briefs that we provide all use open data** so it should not be a problem. However, you should still consider whether there is any confidential or identifiable information that should be anonymised, or whether there is anything you should be wary of putting on a public GitHub repository. If you are using your own real data from a client, there should be clear rules set out on whether you are able to directly refer to the client name and publish any of the data/results to GitHub. Do speak to an instructor if you're unsure about any confidentiality issues with any of the data you're using!

<br> 

## Final Presentation

In the presentation session you will have **up to 10 minutes**, plus time for questions to **present your findings and outputs** back to the business. 

We'd like you to:

* Talk through your approach to the business question
* Discuss any challenges encountered and how you addressed these
* Present a story of your final insights which compels your client to action
* If your solution would require implementation, discuss how this could be done
* Any enhancements you would pick up if you'd had more time
* Any lessons for the future

<br> 

## Asking questions during project weeks 

Instructors will be available to answer questions during the project week but there are requirements for coming with questions:

* Provide a background explanation to your question/task - we may not be as familiar with your project as you are. 
* Evidence you have tried researching a solution before coming to us - we will be asking what you've tried looking up first (whether that be on Google or the notes).  
* We will be aiming to  provide guidance on your problem but not necessarily handing you an answer (because often there isn't a single 'right' answer and it's up to you to make assumptions). 

This is not us being cruel - after this project you won't have instructors to hand to answer questions so **the more practice you get problem solving the better**. Increased practice problem solving is a much more valuable skill that a more 'complete' final project but being handed the answers. 

<br> 

## GitHub

We expect you to have the project on a **new public Github repo**, to which you commit and push regularly any progress you're making on the project. Once you've created your repo, **send the link to your instructors** so we can check how you're getting on! Please also use the **homework forms** to update us on how it's going and if you're facing any issues.

## PDA

If you are completing the PDA, please refer to the provided PDA documents in the `final_project_pda_info` folder **before you get started on the project** to make sure you will be able to meet all the additional requirements. You can also refer to the all learning outcomes being targeted throughout your project work to make sure you're doing the necessary things to pass. Please do ask instructors if you need anything in the PDA documents clarified.
